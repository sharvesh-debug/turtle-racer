# turtle-racer
The racer game we used to play on our keypad mobiles is recreated using Python Turtle. In this game, the turtle interacts with moving cars. If the turtle collides with any car, the game is over. The game contains 6 levels, and the speed of the cars increases with each level. The goal of the turtle is to cross the road without any collisions.
